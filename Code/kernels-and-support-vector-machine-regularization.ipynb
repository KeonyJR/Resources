Meaningful similarity metrics are highly domain specific, with various heuristics and approaches stretching across all the different fields of science available for measuring how much one thing relates to another thing. For example, natural language processing has metrics like [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance). If we are navigating around New York, [taxicab distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) would be meaningful. In machine learning applications more broadly, covariance and correlation are meaningful measurements. And so on.\n","\n","A **kernel** is a specialized kind of similarity function. It takes two points as input, and returns their similarity as output, just as a similarity metric does. A mathematical result from linear algebra known as [Mercer's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer%27s_theorem) has the implication that a broad class of functions (e.g. similarity metrics) may be expressed in terms of a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) in some (possibly very and even infinitely) high dimensional space. This means that calculations performed on points in high-dimensional spaces may be restated in terms of dot products.\n","\n","Dot products are just multiplication, addition, and cosine operations, making them vastly more computationally tractable than performing those same high-dimensional calculations directly. Thus we may take input, transfer it to some extremely high dimensional space, run our machine learning algorithm in that space (by using the kernel function to measure distance, which is fast, instead of computing it directly, which is not), then transfer our results back down to the original input space (class predictions, separating hyperplanes, etcetera). This approach is known as the **kernel trick**.\n","\n","For example: suppose we have features ${x_1, \\ldots, x_{100}}$. We might run our machine learning algorithm in a space that is a kernel which helps us calculate $x_1^2$, $x_1^3, \\ldots x_1^{100}, \\ldots, x_{100}^2, \\ldots, x_{100}^{100}$, and so on. That is an extremely high-dimension space, and calculating the Euclidean distance between two points in that space would be challenging (because $\\sqrt{x_1^4+x_1^6+\\ldots + x_{100}^{200}}$). A kernel that would handle that calculation would greatly increase the speed with which we could do this, and in turn, enable us to better \"sniff out\" separations between classes or relationships between features that exist all the way up to $\\mathbb{P}^{100}$. Real kernels can include even more complex transforms.\n","\n","### SVMs\n","\n","I wrote a primer on support vector machines [here](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/primer-on-support-vector-machines) that is good background reading. Basically, support vector machines are a way of classifying points by building separating hyperplanes between them. Kernels and the kernel trick underpin how SVMs work because they allow the SVM to consider candidate separating hyperplanes in very high dimensions. Once you understand the basics of using the SVM algorithm, the choice of the kernel becomes the most important parameter you can tune."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.svm import SVC\n","from sklearn import datasets\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"_uuid":"d8cb0cd6a067bd556b939cd668285f13ff546dea","collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["iris = datasets.load_iris()\n","X = iris.data[:, :2]\n","y = iris.target"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"464910f5950225ccc3a6097c9dc9fa575aeb73e4"},"source":["## Some kernels\n","\n","Because kernels fundamentally modify how SVMs work, some example results from applying those kernels to a SVM on a toy dataset is a good way to gork the differences between different kernels.

As always, regularization parameters are handy for controlling this. The `sklearn` SVM methods provide `C` and `gamma` functions for this purpose.\n","\n","`gamma` ($\\gamma$) is a multiplier that is applied as a regularization parameter within the kernel calculation. For example, the kernel for RBF is $K(u,v) = \\exp{(-\\gamma || u - v || ^ 2)}$. The larger the $\\gamma$ value the more closely the SVM will fit the data. Since RBF is able to express arbitarily complex shapes (FYI) this leads to a perfectly fitted model a $\\gamma \\to \\infty$. For other kernel functions this regularization parameter is applied at different parts of the calculation, resulting in different effects (but always with higher gamma meaning a closer fit, at risk of overfitting). In addition $\\gamma$ will differ greatly by dataset and by level of normalization. There is no \"right\" gamma level; you will have to recalibrate it every time you approach a new problem. Reference [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/168014/where-can-i-read-about-gamma-coefficient-in-svm-in-scikit-learn).\n","\n","The other regularization parameter is `C`. This is a fixed cost that is added on every time similarity is calculated&mdash;so essentially an [L1 norm](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/l1-norms-versus-l2-norms), in the underlying high-dimensional feature space. Higher levels of C \"fuzz out\" the optimality of the maximally separating hyperplanes generated by the SVM, resulting in more complex decision boundaries, and hence, a higher level of fit.\n","\n","[This AnalyticsVidhya article shows the impact these two parameters have](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/understaing-support-vector-machine-example-code/).
